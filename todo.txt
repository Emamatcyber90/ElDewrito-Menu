Halo 3 Custom Edition To-Do List
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Check if user is in a lobby and load directly into that lobby
2. Pull player armor colors and display them in-lobby
3. Finish controller support and add Playstation layout (DO THIS SOON)
4. Rebuild the changeMenu function to be less messy and bloated
5. Work on CSS for other game styles (Low priority)
6. Add more server browser filters like ping, location, etc.
7. Remake settings to be less bloated and messy (Add return variable, remove changing text from update functions)
8. Add Spartan customization (How do we show armor?)
9. Get player stats showing and working correctly in lobbies
10. Add controls to bottom of menu like Reach
11. Take suggestions from people in IRC for more additions/improvements/bug fixes
12. Integrate in-game chat


Add any suggestions or things I may have missed to this list.

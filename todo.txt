Halo 3 Custom Edition To-Do List
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Check if user is in a lobby and load directly into that lobby
2. Pull player armor colors and display them in-lobby
3. Finish controller support and add PlayStation layout (DO THIS SOON)
4. Remake settings to be less bloated and messy (Add return variable, remove changing text from update functions)
5. Add Spartan customization (How do we show armor?)
6. Get player stats showing and working correctly in lobbies
7. Custom music playlists
8. Matchmaking with voting


Add any suggestions or things I may have missed to this list.
